# SilverLab-Microscope-Software

The Silver Lab Microscopy Software is mostly written in LabVIEW. It has been developed for use with the compact Acousto-Optic Lens Microscope (AOLM) developed in the Silver Lab at UCL. The software is capable of performing multiple imaging modes and protocols including Z-stacks, multi-plane, single-plane, sub-volume, patches and points. It comes with a variety of ready-to-use tools for visualising the data acquired with the system. The software has a modular structure and can communicate with various peripherals. The software can be run on a Windows 7 platform with LabVIEW 2013 (32 bit). The license can be found in the main folder. Detailed documentation on pre-requisites and how to use the software is available in the documentation folder.

Microscope Software was created by The Silver Lab - R. Angus Silver - Department of Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology - University College London - Gower Street - London WC1E 6BT â€“ UK. http://silverlab.org/
